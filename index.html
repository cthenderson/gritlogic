            <h4> Speed </h4>
            <p>
            The ability to explore your existing data and incorporate new data sources quickly is key in business today.
            More important is the ability to do that sooner rather than later. Our data integration services
            and our data tools were built with speed in mind. Our goal is to get your data into your hands as
            soon as possible without the risk and capital intensive investment that many data company's require
            because of the outdated, cumbersome methodologies that they subscribe to.

            <h4> Simplicity </h4>
            <p>
            It is easy to overcomplicate data solutions. There are many problems to solve and many ways to solve them. We believe
            in not only finding the best solution, but also the simplest solution. We don't try to provide you with monolothic
            software packages that solve problems and answer questions that you don't have. We give you what you need, when you need
            it so that you can get back to business.
            </p>

            <h4> Automation </h4>
            <p>
            You've done nothing if you haven't scaled. Having your processes automated is a key factor in building
            the economies of scale to outpace the competition. Our integration and analysis solutions are built to 
            be reproduceable, scaleable, and reliable. In short, we ensure the gains you see by implementing our
            solutions aren't diminished by the cost of their operation.

          <div>
            <h4> Analysis </h4>
            <p>
            We do reporting. Everyone does reporting. But, we pride ourselves on our analyses. Our analysts are some of
            the best in the business, and they deliver solutions that are cutting edge and provide you with much more
            insight than a list reports or a bunch of sums and averages can.
            </p>

            <h4> Storage </h4>
            <p>
            Storing data can be capital intensive if that's not what you do as a company. It is often better to utilize
            storage as a service rather than worrying about the hardware maintenance and software licensing required to
            maintain your own data center. We only charge you for what you use. This flexibility allows your organization
            to quickly scale your data storage needs without the time and capital requirements of the DIY approach.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h4> Security </h4>
            <p>
            Making sure that your data is secure is key. We offer security consulting and solutions to ensure that your data
            is safe. We have full-time security professionals that understand your data security needs. Whether you are
            managing your data on-site or in the cloud, we can make sure that it is protected.
